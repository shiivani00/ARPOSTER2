This AR poster was done on Unity. The aim of this project is to create a product similar to an image on a poster and animate it on Unity and as soon as you hold the poster in front of a camera, the animated product should pop out of the poster. In this case, a poster of a barbarian warrior was used and the model was downloaded from the asset store and imported onto unity. This model was then animmate to walk. So as soon as the image is held in front of a camera, a walking Barbarian warrior will pop out!
